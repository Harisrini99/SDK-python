# RecastAI - Python SDK

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RecastAI/SDK-ruby/master/misc/logo-inline.png "Recast.AI")

Recast.AI official SDK for Python.


## Synospis

!! This is still a work in progress, do not use it yet !!

This gem is a pure Python interface to the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) API. It allows you to make requests to your bots.


## Requirements

*


## Installation

### Via Terminal

From [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip):

```bash
pip install recastai
```


## Usage

### Gem

```python
import recastai

client = Client(YOUR_TOKEN)
response = client.text_request(YOUR_TEXT)
#response = client.file_request(open(YOUR_FILE, 'rb'))

if (response.intent is YOUR_EXPECTED_INTENT):
  # Do your code...
```

## Specs

### Classes

This module contains 5 main classes, as follows:

* Client is the client allowing you to make requests.
* Response contains the response from [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai).
* Sentence represents a sentence of the response.
* Entity represents an entity found by Recast.AI in your user's input.
* RecastError is the error thrown by the gem.

Don't hesitate to dive into the code, it's commented ;)

### Client

The Recast.AI Client can be instanciated with a token and provides the two following methods:

* text_request(text, \*\*options) *Performs a text request*
* file_request(file, \*\*options) *Performs a voice file request*

*Accepted options are 'token', to override the default token provided at initialization*

```ruby
import recastai

client = Client(YOUR_TOKEN)

# Performs a text request on Recast.AI
response = client.text_request(YOUR_TEXT)

if response.intent is YOUR_EXPECTED_INTENT
  # Do your code...
end

# Performs a voice file request on Recast.AI
response = client.file_request(open(YOUR_FILE, 'rb'), { token: YOUR_TOKEN }) # TODO

if response.intent is YOUR_EXPECTED_INTENT
  # Do your code...
end
```

### Response

The Recast.AI Response is generated after a call with the two previous methods and contains the following methods:

* raw(\*) *Returns the raw unparsed response*
* source(\*) *Returns the source sentence Recast.AI processed*
* intents(\*) *Returns all the matched intents*
* intent(\*) *Returns the first matched intent*
* sentences(\*) *Returns all the detected sentences*
* sentence(\*) *Returns the first detected sentence*
* get(name) *Returns the first entity matching -name-*
* all(name) *Returns all the entities matching -name-*
* version(\*) *Returns the version of the JSON*
* timestamp(\*) *Returns the timestamp at the end of the processing*
* status(\*) *Returns the status of the response*

```ruby
response = client.text_request('Give me some recipes with potatoes. And cheese.')

# Get the first sentence, aka 'Give me some recipes with potatoes'
first_sentence = response.sentence

# If the first intent matched 'recipe'...
if response.intent is 'recipe'
  # ...get all the entities matching 'ingredient'
  ingredients = response.all('ingredient')

  puts "The request has been filled at #{response.timestamp}"
end
```

### Sentence

The Recast.AI Sentence is generated by the Recast.AI Response initializer and provides the following methods:

* source(\*) *Returns the source of the sentence*
* type(\*) *Returns the type of the sentence*
* action(\*) *Returns the action of the sentence*
* agent(\*) *Returns the agent of the sentence*
* polarity(\*) *Returns the polarity (negation or not) of the sentence*
* entities(\*) *Returns all the entities detected in the sentence*

```ruby
response = client.text_request('Tell me a joke.')
# Get the first sentence
sentence = response.sentence

if sentence.action is 'tell' && sentence.polarity is 'positive'
  # Tell a joke...
end
```

### Entity

The Recast.AI Entity is generated by the Recast.AI Sentence initializer and provides the following method:

* name(\*) *Returns the name of the entity*
* raw(\*) *Returns the raw text on which the entity was detected*

In addition to this method, more attributes are generated depending of the nature of the entity, which can be one of the following:

* hex(\*)
* value(\*)
* deg(\*)
* formated(\*)
* lng(\*)
* lat(\*)
* unit(\*)
* code(\*)
* person(\*)
* number(\*)
* gender(\*)
* next(\*)
* grain(\*)
* order(\*)

```ruby
response = client.text_request('What can I cook with salmon ?')

if response.intent is 'recipe'
  # Get the ingredient
  ingredient = response.get('ingredient')

  puts "You asked me for a recipe with #{ingredient.value}"
end

```

### RecastError

The Recast.AI Error is thrown when receiving an non-200 response from Recast.AI.

As it inherits from Exception, it implements the default exception methods.
